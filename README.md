# digisparkfi
Simple program that I wrote to work around Digispark Keyboard library not supporting non-US keyboard layouts. The program takes a string as an argument and outputs code that can be copypasted to Arduino IDE. When executed, the Digispark will type the string correctly when using Finnish keyboard layout. Not a great solution, but hey, it was quick and it works!
